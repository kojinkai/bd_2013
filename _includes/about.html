                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Lewis, a Web Designer and Front End Developer from London, and this site is my showcase.</p>
                <p>I mainly specialise in Front End Development and Visual Design and I have enjoyed success operating in agile teams where design &amp; development overlap. I'm currently looking for a new permanent role or long-term contract.</p>
                <p>Web standards and accessibility form the basis of my HTML and that means clean, semantically rich markup and color consideration amongst other things.  For the sake of maintainability and performance, I also aim to keep functionally discrete parts of a website or app separated.  That is to say HTML for markup, CSS for styling and JavaScript for event handling, AJAX calls and other behavioural enhancements.  With the recent rise of client MVC-type frameworks this approach is beginning to inspire <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li4Y0E_x8zE" title="Nicholas Zakas Talks about JavaScript Performance"> some debate </a>but I feel it is a solid foundation and important stepping stone in the path towards maintainability and accessible Front-End code.</p>
                <p>I'm also obsessed with performance, both in terms of HTTP overheads but also in terms of the design performing on the multitude of web enabled devices in circulation today.  This is undoubtably one of the biggest shifts in recent times for Front End developers and UI designers. Its a shift that continues to throw up interesting problems and solutions, with new mobile design patterns now emerging and Front End performance now common in discussions within this working space.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, i'm constantly mindful of all the new things there are to learn about this exciting career and never rest on my laurels, instead choosing to constantly operate at the very tip of my expertise, absorbing all the best-practices and wisdom handed down from the industry thought-leaders as I continue to step forward and become a better pro every day.</p>

                <h2>About this Site</h2>
                <p>This site is powered by a site generation tool called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll Site Generator">Jekyll </a>which is a framework authored and maintained by the team at Github.  It serves as the recommended framework for creating custom Github pages and that is indeed how I discovered Jekyll - by creating the Github page for my current organisation, Dachis Group UK.</p>
                <p>The learning curve for this framework is really quite shallow, and I found it really easy to get to grips with and so it became a natural fit for a static site such as this.  It's easily installed as a RubyGem and can get you moving quickly and effortlessly.  The documentation is excellent and has to-date been a pleasure to work with. Having said that, asset compilation quickly became an issue, but more on that later.  Shortly after starting the development of this site I discovered <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/" title="middleman app">Middleman App </a> and so I'm keen to have a look at that also.</p>
                <p>With this site I have aimed to reduce the amount of clutter in the HTML and by farming a lot of the classes out to SASS Mixins I aimed to keep the HTML as lean and meaningful as possible.  This was inspired by the <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/" title="neat SASS framework">neat </a>SASS grid framework I adopted for this project.</p>
                <p>Along with this framwork I opted to use <a href="http://bourbon.io" title="bourbon framework">Bourbon</a>, a SASS mixin framework for a leg-up with vendor-prefixed properties and highly readable SASS stylesheets. I would recommend this approach highly, again, both frameworks are easily installed as Ruby Gems and can get you set up in a matter of minutes.  Having previously authored custom CSS frameworks for a few projects, I can't emphasise enough how much I appreciated the elegance and simplicity of this approach. It really allows you to focus on the more difficult custom aspects of the site.</p>
                <p>Speaking of difficult aspects, I quickly found that asset compilation was becoming an issue that was looming large from the get-go so I opted to tackle it right away.</p>
                <p>My experience with working on several Rails projects has fostered a deep appreciation for the Asset Pipeline and although someone has developed an asset pipeline for Jekyll, I opted to use this as an opportunity to better my understanding of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" title="grunt js">Grunt.js</a>, the excellent and popular JavaScript task runner.</p>
                <p>Grunt is currently configured to run jshint on the JavaScript - which in my opinion is far better than running it from Sublime Text (as I had done previously) - and compile the SASS and concatenate and minify the JavaScript. I used it to dive into unit tests with qUnit on the jQuery plugins I developed for this site. As an aside, unit testing is another area I'm keen to explore, with Mocha, Chai and Sinon seemingly proving popular with JavaScript developers who practice BDD.</p>
                <p>Grunt is a tool i'm really pleased to have begun to integrate as its a real safety net ensuring good code quality. It takes care of all the asset compression and helps you achieve the optimisation we so often talk about as a central tenet of good Front End Development.  It's also unobtrusive and I have used it successfully on a number of projects now.</p>

                <h2>About Developing for the Mobile Landscape</h2>
                <p>Taking into consideration the huge variety of web-enabled devices has evolved from being a bolt-on component or even out-of-scope, to a central project requirement and UX consideration.  This has been my experience as new and existing clients have come to us with campaign ideas and enhancements to existing platforms.  It's clear that the now feted Responsive Design paradigm is a preferable option in most cases over maintaining a separate mobile site on a sub-domain.  Within Dachis Group, where I work, this responsibility has fallen largely upon my shoulders and so most of the business logic of responsive design, rightly or wrongly, has fallen withing the domain of UI Design and Front End Development.</p>
                <p>This has presented me with an interesting problem.  How can you take the same content, complete with one minified scripts package to cut down on HTTP overhead, and serve that up to your mobile users with the knowledge that most of the functionality they will be getting served won't even be executed or enhance their experience?</p>
                <p>I'm certainly not the first person to wrangle with this catch 22-type situation and so for this site I took a bit of advice from the developers who built the now infamous Boston Globe website. After reading the <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax_includes_modular_content/" title="filamentgroup ajax includes for modular content/">blog post</a> they put out, I began thinking about how I could enhance the experience for desktop users with higher bandwidth and faster connections and cut down the network overhead to a bare minimum for mobile devices.  I already had Modernizr.js being served up as part of my development boilerplate so I knew that <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/" title="yepnope js">yepnope.js </a>was being bundled anyhow.  So I set about writing a test that would determine wheter a mobile device was requesting the page, and if it was, asynchronously serve up an enhancements package.  This package was in effect mainly jQuery plugins that relied upon either bigger screens or scroll events that were either buggy or unneccesary on touch-enabled devices.</p>
                <p>This was achieved by doing a quick Regex match on the User Agent string.  This approach is not without it's pitfalls, and feature detection is still a better option for desktop browsers.  But I have read on a couple of occasions that this is still the best way to tailor an experience for mobile, rather than doing complex feature detection in a runaway mobile landscape.</p>
                <p>Along with this, I loaded the navigation menu within the callback to the yepnope JavaScript load callback.  The menu became an unneccesary UI component for mobile and tablet so I didn't load it and I also wanted to preserve the full page splash effect for tablets that I thought looked really nice.</p>

                <h2>Designing for Scalability</h2>
                <p>So with all of the above in mind, I wanted to ensure that my graphics were crisp and precise with hi-resolution displays.  I had already been a big advocate of using SVG as they are lightweight and fairly easy to polyfill for older browsers.  This felt perfect for the Box Deluxe logo I had worked on and really ensure that it reproduced beautifully across all the displays I tested it on.</p>
                <p>However, the most interesting thing I used was a custom font set for the UI components and social media icons.  I used the<a href="http://icomoon.io/app/" title="icomoon app">Icomoon</a> app to generate a lightweight custom font from the icons I had designed in Illustrator.  This allowed me to trim significant HTTP requests and also include only the icons I actually needed in a custom set.  I can also keep my icon sets stored within the app ready for download or modification.  It really is an excellent app, just another part of the toolkit that continues to astound me, it's really fantastic, and free!</p>

                <h2>A Note on Visual Design</h2>
                <p>So far I have neglected to talk about the visual design which I think is possibly symptomatic of the fact that I adopted so many new ideas in the Front End Development aspect of the build.  Having said that, I should add a not about the visual design.</p>
                <p>Throughout this process, I felt it was important not to design in a vacuum - that is to say that considering performance and accessibility is as much a design concern as it is a Front End concern.  I think this is where much of the benfit of having Design oriented Front End Developers is really seen.</p>
                <p>The main requirement of this site was to showcase my Front End Capabilites as well as my Design Skills and so crisp, bold colours and sharp vector lines not only added impact visually, but also offered enhanced performance in terms of CSS rendering and fewer HTTP requests.</p>
                <p>I should add that the design was a nod towards the current tendency towards the so-called flat UI designs. I wanted elegance and simplicity but I also wanted relevance.  Flat UI design may well be a reaction to our skeumorphic roots but it offers convenient performance gains I was looking for also.</p>
                <p>But this is my site, my personality and the logo design was my opportunity to let some of that personality come through.  I collect vintage guitars and amps and love the music of the 50's and 60's so I wanted to weave some of that distinctive era into my design.  The Cocktail Shaker font was a perfect fit and with a few tweaks to the vector lines I had a new logo that really felt as though it summed up my personality.  I have had the pleasure of designing a couple of logos during my time at Dachis Group and several prior to that so I called upon that experience to make something simple but feeling like a very comfortable fit with my style.</p>

                <p>So thanks for reading, feel free to get in touch with my via the social channels on the main page.  This should have given you a flavour of the diversity of my skills and general approach. Suffice to say, there is a great deal I have not covered and most of the preceding words have centered on the Front End Development aspect of my work.</p>
                <p>That said, I will always feel a strong affinity for design and love working in the area where creative disciplines and technology overlap.</p>
                <p>I am currently open to new job openings.  If you're an employer who thinks I would be a good fit, please feel free to get in touch with details.  No recruiters please.</p>
