                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Lewis, a Web Designer and Front End Developer from London, and this site is my showcase. I'm currently looking for a new permanent role.</p>
                <p>I specialise HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript, as well as Visual Design and can draw upon a good deal of experience working within agile teams at the intersection of design &amp; development.</p>
                <p>Web standards, accessibility and progressive enhancement inform my approach when creating web experiences, with CSS and object-oriented JavaScript layered on top of a base of semantically rich HTML.  All of this I aim to achieve with as few a bytes as possible as I look to squeeze more speed and performance from my pages.</p>
                <p>On top of this, I ensure that my designs and my code perform on the multitude of web enabled devices in circulation today. This is undoubtably one of the biggest shifts in recent times for Front End developers and UI designers. It's a shift that continues to throw up interesting problems and solutions, with new mobile design patterns, performance tweaks and best-practices emerging all the time.</p>
                <p>With that in mind, I use every project as an opportunity to learn new skills and I try to operate at the sharp edge of my expertise. I keep up to date with news and absorb all the best-practices and wisdom handed down from the industry thought-leaders as I continue to become a better pro every day.</p>

                <h2>About this Site</h2>
                <p>This site is powered by a site generation tool called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll Site Generator">Jekyll</a> which is a framework authored and maintained by the team at Github.</p>
                <p>When I started out using Jekyll for a Github pages project a few months ago I found it really easy to get to grips with and so it became a natural fit for creating a static site such as this.  It's easily installed as a RubyGem and can get you moving quickly and effortlessly.  The documentation is excellent and has to-date been a pleasure to work with. Having said that, compiling and compressing the CSS and JavaScript for production was one obstacle I needed to overcome, but more on that later.</p>
                <p>With this site I have aimed to reduce the amount of clutter in the HTML and by fully adopting SASS I was able to keep the HTML as lean and meaningful as possible.  This was inspired by the <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/" title="neat SASS framework">Neat</a> grid framework, which I adopted for this project, and I really like their philosophy.</p>
                <p>Along with this framework I opted to use <a href="http://bourbon.io" title="bourbon framework">Bourbon</a>, a SASS mixin library that helps keep my stylesheets very readable and easy understand. I would recommend both of these libraries for this sort of project, both are easily installed as RubyGems and can get you set up in a matter of minutes.  Having previously authored custom CSS frameworks for a few projects, I can't emphasise enough how much I appreciated the elegance and simplicity of this approach. It really helped me focus on the custom aspects of the site and maintain velocity.</p>
                <p>One such custom aspect I opted to tackle at the beginning of this build was how I was going to compile and compress my assets. I was mainly using SVG, which are quite easy to optimise, and raster images can be compressed with ImageOptim, a handy piece of desktop software. But I needed a way to concatenate and minify my scripts and my CSS.</p>
                <p>I have experience of working on several Ruby on Rails projects and so this type of asset compression comes built in. But in this instance I needed to find a similar, bolt-on solution. I did find a third-party asset pipeline plugin for Jekyll, but I opted instead to better my understanding of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" title="grunt js">Grunt.js</a>, the excellent and popular JavaScript task runner.</p>
                <p>Grunt is currently set up to test my JavaScript code for syntax errors and handle the compression.  I also configured Grunt to run unit tests against the custom jQuery plugins I wrote for the site too.  Unit testing is an area I'm really keen to explore and Grunt now supports most of the popular testing frameworks.</p>
                <p>Grunt is a tool i'm really pleased to have begun to integrate as it's a real safety net ensuring good code quality. It takes care of all the asset compression I mentioned and helps you achieve the optimisation we so often talk about as a central tenet of good Front End Development.  It plays well with lots of different technologies and I have used it successfully on a number of projects now.</p>

                <h2>About Developing for the Mobile Landscape</h2>
                <p>Catering for the huge variety of web-enabled devices in the wild is now a central project consideration.  This has been my experience as new and existing clients have come to us with new campaign ideas as well as enhancements to existing platforms.  It's clear that the now feted Responsive Design paradigm is a preferable option in most cases - as opposed to maintaining a separate mobile site on a sub-domain - and within Dachis Group, where I currently work, I have taken ownership of this aspect of development. It has presented me with some interesting problems to solve.</p>
                <p>One such problem I encountered whilst developing this site is that I wanted to concatenate JavaScript and CSS files to cut down on the number HTTP requests, but at the same time offer tailored and enhanced experiences depending on device capabilities or viewport width. I was keen to avoid forcing mobile and tablets users to download any additional bytes that wouldn't enhance their experience or might not even be executed at all.</p>
                <p>In the end I took a bit of advice from the developers who built the now infamous Boston Globe website. After reading their <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax_includes_modular_content/" title="filamentgroup ajax includes for modular content/">blog post</a> which explained some of their process, I began thinking about how I could enhance the experience for desktop users with bigger viewports but still cut down the network overhead to include only those resources that would be used for smaller devices.  I already had Modernizr.js being served up as part of my development boilerplate so I knew that <a href="http://yepnopejs.com/" title="yepnope js">yepnope.js</a> was being bundled along with it.  So I set about writing a test that would determine whether a mobile device was requesting the page, and if it was, serve up an additional enhancements package.  This package was in effect mainly jQuery plugins that only made sense with larger screens or were unneccesary on touch-enabled devices.</p>
                <p>This was achieved by doing a quick Regex match on the user agent string.  This approach is not without it's pitfalls, and feature detection is still a better option for desktop browsers.  But I have read on a couple of occasions that this is still the best way to tailor an experience for mobile, rather than doing complex feature detection in a runaway mobile landscape.</p>
                <p>Along with this, I loaded the navigation menu in the same fashion.  The menu became an unneccesary UI component for mobile and tablet so I chose to do away with it entirely on tablets and mobile devices. I also wanted to preserve the full page splash effect for tablets that I thought that looked really nice.</p>

                <h2>Designing for Scalability</h2>
                <p>So with all of the above in mind, I wanted to ensure that my graphics were crisp and precise even on hi-resolution displays.  I had already been a big advocate of using SVG as they are lightweight and fairly easy to polyfill for older browsers.  They are perfect for crisp logo vector lines and the Box Deluxe logo was beautifully clear on all the displays I tested it on.</p>
                <p>However, the most interesting thing I used was a custom font set for the UI components and social media icons.  I used the <a href="http://icomoon.io/app/" title="icomoon app">Icomoon</a> app to generate a lightweight custom font from the icons I had designed in Illustrator.  This not only allowed me to trim significant HTTP requests, but also include only those icons I actually needed in a custom set.  I can also keep my icon sets stored within the app ready for download or modification.  Icomoon really is an excellent app, just another part of the toolkit that continues to astound me, it's fantastic, and free!</p>

                <h2>A Note on Visual Design</h2>
                <p>Throughout this process, I felt it was important not to design in a vacuum - that is to say that I should consider performance and accessibility as much a design concern as a Front End concern.  I think this is where much of the benfit of having design oriented Front End Developers is really seen.</p>
                <p>The main requirement of this site was to showcase my Front End Capabilites as well as my Design Skills and so crisp, bold colours and sharp vector lines not only added impact visually, but also offered enhanced performance in terms of leaning heavily on CSS3 rendering which in turn meant fewer HTTP requests in this case.</p>
                <p>The design was a nod in the direction of the current tendency towards the so-called flat UI. I wanted elegance and simplicity but I also wanted relevance.</p>
                <p>This is my site, my personality and an opportunity to let some of that personality come through.  I collect vintage guitars and amps and love the music of the 50's and 60's so I wanted to weave some of that distinctive era into my design. The main logo was designed using a typeface called Cocktail Shaker and was a perfect fit. With a few tweaks to the vector lines, I had a new logo that really felt as though it summed up my personality.  I have had the pleasure of designing a couple of logos during my time at Dachis Group and several prior to that so I called upon that experience to make something that aligned very comfortably with my style.</p>

                <p>So thanks for reading, this should have given you a flavour of the diversity of my skills and general approach. Suffice to say, there is a great deal I have not covered.</p>
                <p>I will always feel a strong affinity for design &amp; development and love working in the area where creative disciplines and technology overlap.</p>
                <p>I am currently open to new job opportunities.  If you're an employer who thinks I would be a good fit, please feel free to get in touch via the details on the main page.  No recruiters please.</p>
